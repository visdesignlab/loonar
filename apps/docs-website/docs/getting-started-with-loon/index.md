# Getting Started
## Step 1: [Prepare Your Microscopy Data ↗](./data.md)

> #### In short, Loon expects this input:
> - Cell **images** as `.tiff` files
> - Cell **metadata**:
>   - Cell feature descriptions over time _(e.g. mass, x, y, etc.)_ as `.csv` files
>   - Cell segmentation boundaries (outlining each cell) as `GeoJSON` files
> 
> :::note
> _Cell metadata is not generated by Loon._  
> _As an initial step in your workflow, we recommend using software such as [LiveCyte](https://www.phasefocus.com/livecyte) and/or [TrackMate](https://imagej.net/plugins/trackmate/) to generate cell metadata ... so that Loon can visualize it!_
