# Getting Started with Loon
> **Two Loon versions** to choose from:
> 1. **Loon** 
>    - In this version, you upload microscopy data onto a server that Loon hosts on your computer.
>    - You can optionally run a central server where users can upload and access their data over the internet.
>    - ðŸŸ© Easier to prepare data for use in Loon, sharable
>    - ðŸŸ¥ Slower upload
> 2. **Local Loon**  
>    - In this version, your data is not uploaded to a server. 
>    - Instead, you link your data file (local to your computer).
>    - ðŸŸ© Faster upload
>    - ðŸŸ¥ Harder to prepare data for use in Loon
> 
> We recommend using the standard **Loon**.  
> If you iterate your data frequently, without sharing data, we recommend using **Local Loon**.

> #### In short, Loon expects this input:
> - Cell **images** as `.tiff` files
> - Cell **metadata**:
>   - Cell feature descriptions over time _(e.g. mass, x, y, etc.)_ as `.csv` files
>   - Cell segmentation boundaries (outlining each cell) as `GeoJSON` files
> 
> :::note
> _Cell metadata is not generated by Loon._  
> _As an initial step in your workflow, we recommend using software such as [LiveCyte](https://www.phasefocus.com/livecyte) and/or [TrackMate](https://imagej.net/plugins/trackmate/) to generate cell metadata ... so that Loon can visualize it!_
