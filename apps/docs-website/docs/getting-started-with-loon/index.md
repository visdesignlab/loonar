# Getting Started with Loon

## Step 1: [Prepare Your Microscopy Data â†—](./data.md)
>
> #### In short, Loon expects this input:
> - Cell **images** as `.tiff` files
> - Cell **metadata**:
>   - Cell feature descriptions over time _(e.g. mass, x, y, etc.)_ as `.csv` files
>   - Cell segmentation boundaries (outlining each cell) as `GeoJSON` files
> 
> 
> _Cell metadata is not generated by Loon. We recommend using [LiveCyte](https://www.phasefocus.com/livecyte) and / or [TrackMate](https://imagej.net/plugins/trackmate/) when preparing data._

## Step 2: [Deploy Loon â†—](./quickstart.md)
> #### In short,
> Loon must be downloaded and deployed using Docker.
> 
> There are **two Loon versions** to choose from:
> 1. **Loon** 
>    - In this version, you upload your microscopy data to a server to use Loon.
>    - ğŸŸ© Easier to set up, sharable
>    - ğŸŸ¥ Slower upload
> 2. **Local Loon**  
>    - In this version, you don't upload data to a server. You just link your local data file.
>    - ğŸŸ© Faster upload
>    - ğŸŸ¥ Harder to set up
