# Getting Started with Loon

## Step 1: [Prepare Your Microscopy Data](./data.md)
>
> #### At a high level, Loon expects:
> - Cell **images** as `.tiff` files
> - Cell **feature descriptions** over time _(E.g. Mass, x, y, etc.)_ as `.csv` files
> - Cell **segmentation boundaries** (outlining each cell) as `GeoJSON` files
> 
> 
> This works well if your data has been processed by [LiveCyte](https://www.phasefocus.com/livecyte) or [TrackMate](https://imagej.net/plugins/trackmate/)

## Step 2: [Deploy Loon](./quickstart.md)
