DuckDB Findings


1. Can't use type:json if we have a big int, JSON can't serialize it (this is using coordinator.query())
2. Can't do generic select by statement and pass data into VG plot
3. Even if we do use a different plotting structure, cant seem to figure out how to grab results from query functionality
    -> its using apache arrow -- we can probably install something to parse this if necessary


    Queries for quantile:

    
        const res = await vg.coordinator().query(`
            WITH cte AS (
                SELECT approx_quantile("Dry Mass (pg)", 0.5) AS quantile_5
                FROM ${currentExperimentMetadata?.value?.name}_composite_experiment_cell_metadata
            )
            SELECT 
                CAST("Tracking ID" AS VARCHAR) as tracking_id,
                cte.quantile_5
            FROM ${currentExperimentMetadata?.value?.name}_composite_experiment_cell_metadata
            CROSS JOIN cte
            ORDER BY ABS("Dry Mass (pg)" - cte.quantile_5)
            LIMIT 1;`,
        {'type':'json'})
        console.log(res);
