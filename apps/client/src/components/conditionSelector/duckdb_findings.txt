DuckDB Findings


1. Can't use type:json if we have a big int, JSON can't serialize it (this is using coordinator.query())
2. Can't do generic select by statement and pass data into VG plot
3. Even if we do use a different plotting structure, cant seem to figure out how to grab results from query functionality
    -> its using apache arrow -- we can probably install something to parse this if necessary


    Queries for quantile -- finds average mass of every tracking id. takes the quantile of the average mass:

    
        const res = await vg.coordinator().query(`
        WITH cte AS (
            SELECT approx_quantile(avg_mass, 0.5) as quantile_5
            FROM (
                SELECT avg("Dry Mass (pg)") as avg_mass
                FROM ${currentExperimentMetadata?.value?.name}_composite_experiment_cell_metadata
                GROUP BY tracking_id, "Location"
            )
        )
        SELECT 
            CAST("Tracking ID" AS VARCHAR),
            cte.quantile_5
            FROM ${currentExperimentMetadata?.value?.name}_composite_experiment_cell_metadata
            CROSS JOIN cte
            ORDER BY ABS("Dry Mass (pg)" - cte.quantile_5)
            LIMIT 1;`,
        {'type':'json'})
        console.log(res);





    SELECT tracking_id, location, avg("Dry Mass (pg)") from table group by tracking_id, location;



const $test_selection = vg.Selection.intersect();
$test_selection.update({
    source:'test_source',
    predicate:`"Tracking ID" IN (SELECT tracking_id FROM ${currentExperimentMetadata?.value?.name}_composite_experiment_cell_metadata_aggregate WHERE track_length between 0 and 100 )`
})
